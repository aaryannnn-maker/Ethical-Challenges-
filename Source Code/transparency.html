    <h2>The Challenge</h2>
    <p>
      Many AI systems operate as "black boxes," meaning their decision-making processes are opaque even to their creators. 
      In cyber warfare, this lack of transparency hinders accountability, trust, and legal compliance.
    </p>

    <h2>Solutions</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Mandate explainability in AI systems used for defense and cyber operations.</li>
      <li>Invest in research for transparent and interpretable machine learning models.</li>
      <li>Create auditing mechanisms to regularly evaluate AI systems for fairness and compliance.</li>
    </ul>
