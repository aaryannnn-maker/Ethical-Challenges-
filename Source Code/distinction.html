    <h2>The Challenge</h2>
    <p>
      AI systems often struggle to differentiate between military and civilian targets, especially in cyberspace where infrastructure overlaps. 
      Misidentification can lead to devastating consequences for innocent populations.
    </p>

    <h2>Solutions</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Develop more advanced identification algorithms with rigorous accuracy standards.</li>
      <li>Adopt policies requiring exhaustive verification before any offensive cyber operation.</li>
      <li>Promote adherence to International Humanitarian Law (IHL) standards for AI use in war.</li>
    </ul>
